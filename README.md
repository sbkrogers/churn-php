## What is it? ##
`churn-php` is a package that helps you identify php files in your project that could be good candidates for refactoring. It examines each PHP file in the path it is provided and:
* Checks how many commits it has.
* Calculates the cyclomatic complexity.
* Creates a score based on these two values.

The results are displayed in a table:
```

   / __)( )_( )(  )(  )(  _ \( \( )___(  _ \( )_( )(  _ \

A file that changes a lot and has a high complexity might be a better candidate for refactoring than a file that doesn't change a lot and has a low complexity.

`churn-php` only assists the developer to identify files for refactoring. It's best to use the results in addition to your own judgment to decide which files you may want to refactor.

## Compatibility ##
* PHP 7+

## How to Install? ##
Install via Composer:
```
composer require bmitch/churn-php --dev
```

## How to Use? ##
```
vendor/bin/churn run <path to source code>
```

## How to Configure?
You may add an optional `churn.yml` file to the root of your project which can be used to configure churn-php. A sample `churn.yml` file looks like:

```yml
# The maximum number of files to display in the results table.
# Default: 10
filesToShow: 10

# The number of parallel jobs to use when processing files.
# Default 10:
parallelJobs: 10

# How far back in the git history to count the number of commits to a file
# Can be a human readable date like 'One week ago' or a date like '2017-07-12'
# Default '10 Years ago'
commitsSince: One year ago

# Files to ignore when processing. The full path to the file relative to the root of your project is required
# Default: All PHP files in the path provided to churn-php are processed.
filesToIgnore:
 - src/Commands/ChurnCommand.php
 - src/Results/ResultsParser.php
 ```

If a `churm.yml` file is omitted or an individual setting is omitted the default values above will be used.
